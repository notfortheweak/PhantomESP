## What's New in 2.0

The biggest update yet: a rebuilt UI, a native app ecosystem, and expanded radio workflows.

<img width="320" height="170" alt="app-gallery2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7bb96ed-db0c-4777-a721-ded2d397b167" /> <img width="320" height="170" alt="airspace-monitor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e049dfc8-3888-42ec-9fd1-6be62fcec114" />

- **Redesigned UI**: 60 FPS rendering, toasts, SD-loaded asset packs (icons/themes/backgrounds), touch-drag scrolling, and a full accessibility suite.
- **Native SD Apps**: Load, build, and package apps with the new App Gallery, scoped permissions, and the Ghost Build Tool (`gbt`). C5 builds can run app code from flash (XIP).
- **WiFi Airspace Monitor**: Real-time threat insights with adaptive channel dwell, a learned baseline, and a packets/sec sparkline.
- **Expanded Ghostchi**: 50 levels, 27 XP sources, mood system, and a status-bar badge.
- **PIN lockscreen**: Auto-lock overlay — captures keep running while locked.
- **Expanded BadUSB**: Trackpad/mouse jiggler, USB HID output mode, `type_char` CLI, dedicated WebUI page.
- **Redesigned WebUI**: Refreshed interface with better remote control.
- **New network recon**: SSH, NetBIOS, HTTP banner, and SNMP scanners, plus a WPA3 compliance checker.
- **GhostLink BLE bridge**: Bridge a chip to the Android companion app, with `wdstream` wardriving.
- **More boards**: Marauder V8, Pancake C5, LilyGo T-Dongle-S3/C5, S3TWatch haptics, Cardputer ENV-III, and NM-CYD-C5 fixes.
- **Under the hood**: Modularized commandline, shared SD mount helpers, checked allocations, and stability fixes across WiFi/BLE/audio/GPS/NFC.

## Flagship Capabilities

A few things set GhostESP apart from every other ESP32 firmware:

- **Native SD App ecosystem**: Create, package, discover, launch, inspect, and stop SD-loaded apps with permissions and scoped storage. Build your own with `gbt`.
- **ESP-IDF-native architecture**: built directly on Espressif's SDK instead of Arduino/PlatformIO, giving GhostESP tighter control over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB, memory, and low-level hardware features.
- **GhostLink**: dual-ESP32 command/display interface with remote radio, remote keyboard, BLE bridging, and split-channel wardriving.
- **Multi-interface control**: use GhostESP from the on-device UI, Flipper Zero app, serial CLI, WebUI, Android companion app, or GhostLink-connected devices.
- **Broad hardware and radio coverage**: Wi-Fi, BLE, NFC, IR, SubGHz, NRF24, Ethernet, GPS, USB HID, and 802.15.4/Zigbee across 46 board targets.
- **Research-ready capture workflows**: PCAP, hc22000, WiGLE CSV, sweep captures, Wireshark streaming, SD browsing, and on-device export tools.
- **Full graphical UI platform**: carousel, grid, and list layouts with themes, asset packs, touch/keyboard/encoder support, and accessibility options.

`*` — the checked-in config for this board predates a Kconfig option (`NFC_CHAMELEON`) that defaults on for BLE-capable boards; no board-specific override is present, so this reflects the Kconfig default rather than an explicit setting in the file. Most unstarred BLE-capable boards set the symbol explicitly, but some generic configs may also rely on the Kconfig default.

**Display:** `Full` = LVGL graphical UI. `Status` = secondary small status display only (shares the IO-expander I2C bus), no full UI. `—` = headless, no display.

**SD:** most boards use SPI-mode SD. JC3248W535EN and T-Dongle-S3 use SDMMC 1-bit mode instead; the SDMMC bus option exists in Kconfig for other boards.

**NFC (Chameleon):** Chameleon Ultra support rides over BLE, so it's on by default for any BLE-capable board and off where BLE is unavailable (ESP32-S2 boards) or explicitly disabled (Marauder v8, Pancake C5).

**Native SD Apps:** at compile time the feature depends only on `CONFIG_SPIRAM` (`main/Kconfig.projbuild:1410`). At runtime the app gallery checks `MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM` and renders into the full LVGL screen, so a display is required for the UI to be usable. That leaves it enabled on: AWOK Mini, Waveshare/Crowtech/Sunton 7″, JC3248W535EN, T-Deck, T-Embed CC1101, T-Dongle-C5, NM-CYD-C5, Banshee (C5), and Marauder v8/Pancake C5. Boards with a screen but no PSRAM (Cardputer, Cardputer ADV, the CYD2 family, S3TWatch, T-Dongle-S3, etc.) don't get it.

**Banshee** ships as two configs: the S3 main board (headless) and the C5 module that drives its display and status LED, paired over GhostLink.
